// 1. You can't define a variable more than once.

let petName = 'Hul'
petName = 'Spot'

console.log(petName)

// 2. There are rules related to variable names as js permits letters, dollar sign ($),
//    to be used in starting the variable name, then numbers  can be  used eg m3, $3

//3. Variable names can't be reserved keywords.
